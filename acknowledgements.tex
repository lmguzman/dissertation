Luke Harmon has been a tremendous mentor, teacher, collaborator, and friend. He came to know me better than I knew myself and found a way to bring out the best in me and restrain the worst. And he made science fun--there is no one else I would rather make mistakes with. 

I thank my committee: Jack Sullivan, for supporting and challenging me in science and in life; Scott Nuismer, for making sure I knew where I stood; Paul Joyce, for always making time when I got stuck on a problem; and Arne Mooers, for introducing me to evolutionary biology and for keeping me honest over the years.

David Tank was practically a second advisor to me. He took me under his wing and taught me how to think and how to be a scientist. And somehow he was able to convince me that plants are actually pretty awesome (I will never forget the trips out to Clarkia). He opened new doors for me and fostered new collaborations. I am extremely grateful for his generosity, mentorship and friendship. I am also thankful to Larry Forney, for always taking the time to talk to me, and for calling me on my bullshit when I needed it.

I thank Simon Uribe-Convers, Brice Sarver, and Tyler Hether for their years of friendship and endless discussions, about biology and everything else. We have experienced all the ups and downs of graduate student life together and through this, they have become like brothers to me.

I have been lucky to have found some incredible people, who I loved hanging out and doing science with (or just hanging out with). Rich FitzJohn and Josef Uyeda have been extremely influential on my intellectual life. They challenged me to think harder and to never take the easy way out. I have learned so much from both of them and enjoyed ever minute (or at least, most) of the many that we spent together brainstorming ideas, writing papers, and hacking code. I also thank Jon Eastman for getting off his rocket ship to help me whenever I fell off my tricycle. And David Bapst has been my constant sounding board and sparring partner throughout my dissertation. It is only because of him that I can converse with paleontologists without complete embarrassment.

A huge number of people have reached out and guided me in a myriad of ways. Their intellectual and personal generosity is truly humbling. I would particularly like to thank Michael Alfaro, Steve Arnold, Will Cornwell, Bernie Crespi, Joe Felsenstein, David Green, Paul Harnik, Mark Kirkpatrick, Craig Miller, Brian O'Meara, Sally Otto, Erica Bree Rosenblum, Graham Slater, David Swofford, and Amy Zanne.

It has been an incredible privilege to do science in the Harmon/RoHa lab; you guys are the best. I thank James Rosindell, Joseph Brown, Jamie Voyles, Suzanne Joneson, Travis Hagey, Simone Des Roches, Tom Poorten, Kayla Hardwick, Denim Jochimson, Kayla Hardwick, Daniel Caetano, Rafael Maia, and Eliot Miller.

I loved being an IBESTian at the University of Idaho. I am thankful to all the people who made it so fun, both in and out of the office. In particular, I would like to thank Diego Morales-Briones, Sarah Jacobs, Hannah Marx, Daniel Beck, Genevieve Metzger, CJ Jenkins, Matt Singer, Michael France, Luke Caldwell, Chloe Stenkamp-Strahm, Sam Hunter, Matt Settles, Anahi Espindola, Matthieu Delcourt, and Wesly Lofte-Eaton. I thank all the IBEST staff and faculty, especially Lisha Abendorth and Eva Top, for without their boundless patience, I would literally not have finished my Ph.D.

I thank Roxana Hickey for all the things--for celebrating with me when things were going well; for commiserating when things were not; for listening to me rant even when she didn't care; for being my friend; for suffering me when I was insufferable; and for always pushing me to be better. Last, I would like to thank my family: my parents, Rick and Brenna Pennell, and my siblings, Stephen, Alec, and Laura. I cannot even begin to articulate the support they have given me over the years nor my gratitude for it. For once, I have no words.
